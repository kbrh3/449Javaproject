//General Game:
//The game continues until the entire board is filled.
//The winner is the player who has formed the most SOS sequences by the time the board is full.
//If both players have created the same number of SOSs, the game is a draw.
//When a player successfully forms an SOS, they immediately get another turn. 
//This process continues as long as the player keeps forming SOS
//Each playerâ€™s SOS count must be tracked throughout the game -The player with the most SOS sequences at the end of the game wins.
